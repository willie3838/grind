Problem Statement 
Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. 
You should treat numbers of the array as objects, 
hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.
The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; 
and since our input array also consists of three different numbers
that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.

Example 1:
Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
Output: [0 0 1 1 2]

Example 2:
Input: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
Output: [0 0 1 2 2 2 ]

Approach
- two pointers
- if right lands on 0, we swap with left
- if right is already on 2, keep moving
- if left lands on 2 we swap with right
- if left is already on 0, keep moving


2,0,2,1,1,0
0,0,2,1,1,2
0,0,1,1,2,2
